# Microservice Project with Spring Boot

This is a microservice project demonstrating communication between two microservices using RabbitMQ while adhering to clean architecture principles.

## Services

### Customer Service

The Customer service is a REST API that provides a single endpoint for registering a new customer. After registration, a message is sent to a message queue.

Features:

- Integration with Postgres
- Integration with RabbitMQ
- Spring Security (In Progress)
- Memcached (In Progress)

#### Endpoint

- **Endpoint:** `/customer`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Body:**

```
{ "name":"Alanderson Cavalcante Araujo", "email":"alanderson@email.com" }
```

### Email Service

The Email service is responsible for consuming a message queue via RabbitMQ and sending emails using AWS SES (Simple Email Service). It also stores events in MongoDB.

Features:

- Integration with MongoDB
- Integration with RabbitMQ
- Integration with AWS SES
